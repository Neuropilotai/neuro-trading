# 🚀 Super Agent Automation Setup

## Complete Automation: Dashboard → Railway → Stripe → Sync

This system implements **full automation** for your AI business operations. When you approve a gig in your dashboard, super agents automatically:

1. **Deploy to Railway** ✈️
2. **Create Stripe products** 💳
3. **Update all platforms** 🔄
4. **Monitor & sync everything** 👁️

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/davidmikulis/neuro-pilot-ai
npm install node-fetch uuid
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Create or update your `.env` file:
```bash
# Required for Stripe automation
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here

# Optional for email automation  
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Optional for Railway CLI automation
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_railway_token_here
```

### 3. Start the Super Agent Ecosystem
```bash
# Start all super agents at once
node start_super_agent_ecosystem.js
```

Or start individually:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Enhanced Super Agent
cd backend && node enhanced_super_agent.js

# Terminal 2: Platform Integration Super Agent  
cd backend && node platform_integration_super_agent.js

# Terminal 3: Real Business Dashboard
cd backend && node real_business_dashboard.js
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Super agents not connecting:**
```bash
# Check if all ports are available
lsof -i :3010
lsof -i :9000  
lsof -i :9001

# Restart the ecosystem
node start_super_agent_ecosystem.js
```

**Stripe automation not working:**
```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# Test Stripe connection
node -e "console.log(require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY).apiVersion)"
```

**Railway deployment fails:**
```bash
# Check Railway CLI
railway --version

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Check project status
railway status
```

### Health Checks
The ecosystem automatically:
- ✅ Monitors all agents every 30 seconds
- ✅ Restarts failed agents automatically
- ✅ Generates status reports every 5 minutes
- ✅ Handles graceful shutdown on system signals
